# 🏏 IPL 2025 Data-Driven Dream Squad Project

## 📄 Overview

This project showcases a fully **data-driven approach** to building an IPL 2025 dream squad.  
Instead of relying on historical reputation or big names, this squad was created purely using **player impact scores, auction prices, and role balance**, all backed by advanced data analysis and custom algorithms.
